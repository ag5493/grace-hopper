                         She's here evaluating community, and looking for an opportunity to participate.
                         She's might also be here looking for to connect with others around a cause she cares about.
                         Perhaps, she was inspired to get involved after attending a Mozilla event or talk.
                         Lucinda is engaged, but uncertain. <br><br>Lucinda cautionsly lurks on a number of
                         communication channels attempting to evaluate  friendliness, activity and opportunity.
                         She follows what others post, but does not contribute to the conversation.
                         If training and educational opportunities are offered, she will likely engage there first."""
